# Autonomous Race Car

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to program a NXP model car to compete in the race. The software itself uses two cameras, 
one long range camera for detecting the edges of the track, one short range camera for detecting the start line. The race
car uses one servo to steer and two DC motors for propulsion.

## Usage
1. Download code.
2. Compile the code for k64f board.
3. Upload the code.
4. Zoom zoom!

## Result

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mLF0HtRhHY) is my team competing in the 2016 NXP Cup North America. We're one of the two teams representing RIT in the race. The final
reuslt was 4th place out of 6 very competitive teams.
